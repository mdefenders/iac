# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for GCP GKE

This project provides Terraform-based infrastructure automation for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), focusing on Google
Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters, Helm chart deployments, and secure networking.

## Feature Branch Isolation (ArgoCD ApplicationSets)

Deployment supports fully automated feature branch isolation by namespaces, implemented with ArgoCD ApplicationSets.
Each feature branch is deployed into its own isolated namespace, managed by ArgoCD, enabling parallel development and
testing environments.

## Structure

- `it-delivers-everywhere/gcp/environments/dev/` – Environment-specific configs (main.tf, terraform.tfvars, values.yaml,
  etc.)
- `it-delivers-everywhere/gcp/modules/gke/` – GKE cluster and related resources (main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf)
- `tmp/values.yaml` – Example Helm values file

## Features

- Modular GKE cluster provisioning
- Helm chart deployments (e.g., ingress-nginx, argo-appsets)
- Customizable firewall rules for control plane and service access
- IP/subnet whitelisting for secure access
- Environment-specific configuration via tfvars and variables.tf

## Usage

1. Configure your environment in `environments/dev` (edit `terraform.tfvars`, `variables.tf`, `values.yaml`).
2. Run:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
   in your environment folder.
3. Customize firewall whitelists and Helm values as needed.

## Requirements

- Terraform
- Google Cloud credentials
- Helm (for manual chart management, if needed)

## Security

- Firewall rules restrict GKE control plane and service access to specified IPs/subnets.
- Helm chart values are customizable per environment.

## Notes

- Update `terraform.tfvars` to set whitelisted IPs/subnets (e.g., `controlplane_whitelist = ["192.168.0.1"]`).
- Use `variables.tf` to declare all required variables.
- For service/load balancer IPs, retrieve them after deployment using `kubectl get svc -n <namespace>`.

## OCI OKE Deployment Weaknesses and Challenges

Known but hasn't been addressed yet:

- **Control plane exposure** – By default, the provider creates a basic cluster with the control plane exposed to the
  internet. For simplicity, this has not yet been restricted by moving or re-creating the cluster.
- **Ingress-related firewall rules** – Creating an ingress automatically generates firewall rules, which then need to be
  manually imported back into the configuration.
- **Ingress controller limitations** – The native ingress controller is not available in the standard cluster, so the
  NGINX ingress controller is used instead.
- **Object separation** – MySQL and Vault secrets were initially created in the top-level compartment, which resulted in
  tenant-wide secret permissions being granted to OKE nodes. In a production setup, it is recommended to create a
  separate compartment for each object type to enable fine-grained access control.
- **MySQL module** – The current module combines Vault, Secrets, and Policies. These should be separated into a dedicated
  modules.
